## 🚀 What It Does

Every day at **10:15 PM IST**, this bot wakes up on GitHub's servers and:

- ✅ Fetches all LeetCode problems you solved that day
- 📬 Posts them directly to your Discord channel
- 💤 Requires **zero input from you** — PC can be completely off

### Example Discord Message

```
Today (3 problems):
1) https://leetcode.com/problems/find-unique-binary-string
2) https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-smallest-balanced-index
3) https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-operations-to-sort-a-string
```

> If you didn't solve anything, it posts: `No problems solved today`

---

## ⏰ Tracking Window

The bot captures problems solved between **6:15 AM → 10:15 PM IST** daily.

Late night solves (after 10:15 PM) won't be included — keeping your daily log clean and honest.

## 🛠️ Setup Guide

### Step 1 — Get Your LeetCode Cookies

> Your cookies authenticate the request so GitHub's servers aren't blocked by LeetCode.

1. Go to [leetcode.com](https://leetcode.com) and log in
2. Press `F12` → **Application** tab → **Cookies** → `https://leetcode.com`
3. Find and copy these two values:
   - `LEETCODE_SESSION`
   - `csrftoken`

### Step 2 — Create a Discord Webhook

1. Open your Discord server → right-click your channel → **Edit Channel**
2. Go to **Integrations** → **Webhooks** → **New Webhook**
3. Give it a name (e.g. `LeetCode Bot`) and copy the webhook URL

### Step 3 — Add GitHub Secrets

Go to your repo → **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions** → **New repository secret**

| Secret | Value |
|--------|-------|
| `LEETCODE_USERNAME` | Your LeetCode username |
| `LEETCODE_SESSION` | Cookie from Step 1 |
| `LEETCODE_CSRF` | `csrftoken` from Step 1 |
| `DISCORD_WEBHOOK` | Webhook URL from Step 2 |

### Step 4 — You're Done 🎉

Push the code. GitHub Actions handles everything from here.

### Step 5 — Set Up cron-job.org (For Reliable Timing)

GitHub Actions cron can delay by up to 1 hour. Use cron-job.org to trigger it exactly on time.

1. Sign up free at [cron-job.org](https://cron-job.org)
2. Create a new cronjob with:
   - **URL:** `https://api.github.com/repos/YOUR_USERNAME/leetcode-discord-reporter/actions/workflows/YOUR_WORKFLOW_ID/dispatches`
   - **Schedule:** 10:15 PM IST (16:45 UTC)
   - **Method:** POST
   - **Headers:**
     - `Authorization` → `token YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN`
     - `Accept` → `application/vnd.github.v3+json`
   - **Body:** `{"ref":"main"}`
3. Save and test

## 📁 Project Structure

```
leetcode-discord-reporter/
├── send.py                    # Core script — fetches & posts submissions
└── .github/
    └── workflows/
        └── daily.yml          # Scheduler — runs every night at 10:15 PM IST
```

---

## ⚙️ Customization

### Change the posting time

Edit `.github/workflows/daily.yml`:

```yaml
- cron: '45 16 * * *'   # 10:15 PM IST (UTC+5:30)
```

Use [crontab.guru](https://crontab.guru) to convert your time to UTC.

### Change the tracking window

Edit `send.py`:

```python
if now - sub_time < timedelta(hours=16):  # tracks from 6:15 AM IST
```

Increase or decrease the hours as needed.

---

## 🔄 Cookie Refresh (Every ~2 Weeks)

LeetCode session cookies expire. When the bot stops working:

1. Log in to leetcode.com → `F12` → Application → Cookies
2. Copy fresh `LEETCODE_SESSION` and `csrftoken` values
3. Update them in **GitHub → Settings → Secrets**

---

## 🔒 Security Notes

- ✅ All sensitive values are stored as **GitHub Secrets** — never in code
- ⚠️ If your Discord webhook URL leaks, regenerate it immediately:
  `Discord → Channel Settings → Integrations → Webhooks → Regenerate URL`
- ⚠️ Never commit cookies directly into your repo

## 💡 Inspiration

In class one day, our sir mentioned a student from another campus who had built something really cool — a script on his local PC that sent his daily LeetCode solved problem links to the college Discord server (where we're supposed to post daily) with just a single button click. Sir was genuinely impressed, said he only found out about it a few days later.

That story stayed with me. I took that same idea and pushed it a step further — no button, no local PC. Mine just runs automatically every night at 10:15 PM and posts on its own, whether my PC is on or not.

Respect to that guy for the inspiration. 🙏
